# Basic Blog App for my site


My goal here is to create a blog for my
site that allows a lot of freedom by giving
a big blank slate, allowing some JavaScript and
CSS to be added to the blog post, so that
you're doing more than creating similar articles,
but can do something unique with each post.

Most likely my posts will be infrequent, so I want
a lot of creative control over how the post works.

Updates to follow.
